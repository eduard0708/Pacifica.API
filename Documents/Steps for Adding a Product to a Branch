Steps for Adding a Product to a Branch:
Create a Product:

A product is created in the Product table with properties like ProductId, ProductName, Category, CostPrice, RetailPrice, etc.
Create a Branch:

A branch is created in the Branch table with properties like BranchId, BranchName, Location, etc.
Associate Product with Branch (through the Junction Table):

Once both the Product and Branch are created, you associate them through a junction table (for a many-to-many relationship). This table holds the ProductId, BranchId, and any additional details like StockQuantity, SKU, etc.
Update Stock for the Branch:

When adding the product to a branch, you can track the stock for the product at that branch using fields like StockQuantity in the BranchProduct table. This table links products to branches and can hold inventory-specific data.
Handle Transactions (Optional):

If you are tracking transactions (like sales or stock updates), these would also be recorded in a Transaction table, linking the Product and Branch.


Example Implementation in C#
1. Product Table:

csharp
Copy code
public class Product
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public decimal CostPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal RetailPrice { get; set; }
    public int StockQuantity { get; set; }
    public string SKU { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateAdded { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastUpdated { get; set; }
}


If you are creating a Product and adding it to a Branch, and if you're using a many-to-many relationship model (with a junction table like BranchProduct), here’s how the process would typically work:

{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }

    public int StockQuantity { get; set; }
    public string SKU { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateAdded { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastUpdated { get; set; }
}
2. Branch Table:

csharp
Copy code
public class Branch
{
    public int BranchId { get; set; }
    public string BranchName { get; set; }
    public string BranchLocation { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }
}

3. Junction Table (Product ↔ Branch Relationship):

csharp
Copy code
public class BranchProduct
{
    public int BranchId { get; set; }
    public Branch Branch { get; set; } // Navigation Property

    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public Product Product { get; set; } // Navigation Property

    public int StockQuantity { get; set; }
    public string SKU { get; set; }
}

How It Works:
Creating a Product:

You create a Product instance and save it to the Products table.
Creating a Branch:

You create a Branch instance and save it to the Branches table.
Adding Product to Branch:

Create a new instance of the BranchProduct table, linking the ProductId and BranchId.
Set the StockQuantity and SKU for the product in that branch.
Saving to Database:

Save the new BranchProduct record to the database. This will establish the relationship between the Product and the Branch.

Example of Adding Product to Branch:
csharp
Copy code
public async Task AddProductToBranch(int productId, int branchId, int quantity)
{
    var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(productId);
    var branch = await _context.Branches.FindAsync(branchId);

    if (product != null && branch != null)
    {
        var branchProduct = new BranchProduct
        {
            ProductId = productId,
            BranchId = branchId,
            StockQuantity = quantity,
            SKU = product.SKU // or create a specific SKU for the branch
        };

        await _context.BranchProducts.AddAsync(branchProduct);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}

Handling Transactions (Optional):
When you add a product to a branch, you can also associate it with a Transaction. For example, when the product is received at the branch, you could record this in the Transaction table:

csharp
Copy code
public async Task AddProductTransaction(int productId, int branchId, int quantity, string transactionType)
{
    var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(productId);
    var branch = await _context.Branches.FindAsync(branchId);

    if (product != null && branch != null)
    {
        var transaction = new Transaction
        {
            ProductId = productId,
            BranchId = branchId,
            TransactionType = transactionType,
            TransactionDate = DateTime.Now,
            Quantity = quantity,
            TransactionName = "Received from Supplier",
            CreatedBy = 101 // example user id
        };

        await _context.Transactions.AddAsync(transaction);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}

This way, when a product is received, sold, or transferred across branches, you can log the transaction and update the stock accordingly.

Summary:
Many-to-many: A Product can exist in multiple Branches, and a Branch can have multiple Products.
Use a junction table (like BranchProduct) to link products to branches and store additional information like stock quantities.
Optionally, use Transaction tables to track inventory changes (e.g., sales, restocks, transfers).
